// The folder name "(auth)" is a convention to indicate that the folder contains authentication-related pages. This helps in organizing the code and making it clear that the pages inside this folder are related to user authentication, such as login, registration, and password recovery.

// also it help to manage all auth related pages in one place, and it can be easily identified by developers who are new to the project. It also helps to avoid naming conflicts with other pages in the application. therre is no need to acces page by http://localhost:3000/auth/login
// instead of that we can access it by http://localhost:3000/login
